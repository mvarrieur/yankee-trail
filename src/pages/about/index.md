        Our entire motel underwent complete renovation in 2022 - down to the
        studs.  All rooms have new electric (include USB outlets), plumbing,
        bathrooms, floors, walls, doors, windows, heat and air conditioning.
        Exterior enhancements are also complete with a new walkway and vinyl
        front, while keeping our red, white and blue theme. (Welcoming red doors
        are in progress.)


        Our floorplans are spacious, and all rooms offer a mini-fridge, microwave, Keurig coffee maker (coffee provided) and blow dryers. We currently offer three King rooms and seven rooms with two double (full) beds.  


        Many other amenities available upon request, such as iron and ironing boards, forgotten toiletries, etc.

      text: When you come to our restaurant, you enter our home - or at least the
        heart of it. We offer real 'Mom's home cooking!'  Start your day at the
        appetizer station with oven-baked pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, granola
        bars, oatmeal, juice and coffee while we create your special-ordered,
        hot, American breakfast. Our aim is to get you off to a great start
        while you prepare to enjoy the Lakes Region and Mountain air!

    The perfect getaway.  The Yankee Trail is in the heart of the Lakes and
    Mountains region of NH and offers guests all the comforts of home.  Close to
    many attractions, including the Holderness Natural Science Center, Laconia’s
    Weirs Beach, everything Lincoln, Waterville Valley and Gun Stock, to name a
    few.  The area boasts adventures of all kinds, including golf, fishing,
    hiking, snowmobiling, ATVing, zip lines, area beaches and local trails.


    Perhaps you'll prefer to reserve an area boat or train ride to really take in the sights!  We are the perfect location for being near it all but not in it all; allowing you to participate yet take a break when you need one!  We are a perfect location for access to Lake Squam, Newfound Lake, and Winnipesauki Fishing and Pond Hockey Tournaments, as well as for Laconia's bike week.  Or maybe you are attending a concert/event at the nearby BNH Pavilion. (Fun Fact: We are one of the very few who offer a one-night stay!)  Better yet, create your own event right here on our grounds! Gather your friends and family and come enjoy all the Yankee Trail has to offer.

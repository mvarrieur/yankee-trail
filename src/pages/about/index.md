    The perfect getaway.  The Yankee Trail is in the heart of the Lakes and
    Mountains region of NH and offers guests all the comforts of home.  The
    Yankee Trail is close to many attractions, including the Holderness Natural
    Science Center, Laconia’s Weirs Beach, everything Lincoln, Waterville Valley
    and Gun Stock, to name a few.  The area boasts adventures of all kinds,
    including golf, fishing, hiking, snow mobiling, ATVing, zip lines, area
    beaches, and local trails.


    Perhaps you'll prefer to reserve an area boat or train ride to really take in the sights!  We are the perfect location for being near it all, but not in it all; allowing you to participate and to take a break when you need one!  We are a perfect location for Winnepesauki Fishing and Pond Hockey Tournaments, as well as for Laconia's bike week.  Gather your friends and family and come enjoy all the Yankee Trail has to offer.  


    We are announcing new specials for 2021 - be sure to book early!

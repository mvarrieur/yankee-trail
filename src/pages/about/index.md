        Currently, our entire motel is under complete renovation - down to the
        studs.  Come spring 2022, all rooms will have new electric, plumbing,
        bathrooms, floors, walls, doors, windows, heat and air conditioning.
        Exterior enhancements are also in store, with a faux stone and vinyl
        front, while keeping our red, white and blue theme.


        Our floorplans are spacious, and all rooms offer a mini-fridge, microwave, Keurig coffee maker (coffee provided) and blow dryers. We currently offer three King rooms and seven rooms with two double (full) beds.

    The perfect getaway.  The Yankee Trail is in the heart of the Lakes and
    Mountains region of NH and offers guests all the comforts of home.  The
    Yankee Trail is close to many attractions, including the Holderness Natural
    Science Center, Laconia’s Weirs Beach, everything Lincoln, Waterville Valley
    and Gun Stock, to name a few.  The area boasts adventures of all kinds,
    including golf, fishing, hiking, snowmobiling, ATVing, zip lines, area
    beaches, and local trails.


    Perhaps you'll prefer to reserve an area boat or train ride to really take in the sights!  We are the perfect location for being near it all but not in it all; allowing you to participate and to take a break when you need one!  We are a perfect location for Lake Squam, Newfound Lake, and Winnipesauki Fishing and Pond Hockey Tournaments, as well as for Laconia's bike week.  Or maybe you are attending a concert/event at the nearby BNH Pavilion. Better yet, create your own event right here on our grounds! Gather your friends and family and come enjoy all the Yankee Trail has to offer.

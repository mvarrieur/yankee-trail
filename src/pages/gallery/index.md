    text: Our grounds are also in the process of being updated.  Windows from the
      back of the motel were removed to allow more privacy for guests. What will
      be done with the space is still under consideration - a fenced area for
      pets? A conversation area? A sunbathing area? Maybe a little of each...
      come visit to find out!

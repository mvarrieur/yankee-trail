        Our Breakfast Restaurant is completely remodeled and will reopen in
        Spring 2021!  We offer indoor and outdoor seating, and our restaurant is
        open to the public! Our 2021 menu is planned and we look forward to
        providing our guests and the local community with deliciously hot meals
        to enjoy before beginning each day's adventure!  Selections include your
        basic omelets, pancakes, French toast, bacon and egg options, as well as
        pancake pops for those young at heart and incredible breakfast
        sandwiches on grilled French bread!  Got a particular diet need? Let us
        know, and we will do our best to accommodate.  Weekend specials also
        offered! 
         Mmm.... Once our restaurant does reopen, our hours will be 7:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. every Friday - Sunday.

      text: In February 2020, we welcomed Rick and Lise Miller from Salem, NH, to our
        team.  Rick and Lise have graciously pulled themselves from the depths
        of retirement to work their magic in our kitchen.  Lise is a former
        restaurant owner and brings with her behind-the-scenes restaurant
        experience, as much as she brings experience from behind the
        griddle.  You will not be disappointed!

        Our Breakfast Restaurant is currently under renovation and will
        hopefully open soon.  We are busy planning our breakfast menu and
        anticipate providing our guests a delicious hot meal to enjoy before
        beginning each day's adventure!  Selections will include your basic
        omelettes, pancakes, french toast, bacon and egg options, as well as
        pancake pops for those young at heart and incredible breakfast
        sandwiches on grilled french bread!  Mmm....

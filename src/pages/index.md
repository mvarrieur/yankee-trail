        Our Breakfast Restaurant was completely remodeled and reopened in Spring
        2021.  We renamed the restaurant KC's Kitchen & Catering in September
        2021, when local Chef/General Manager, Rachel Robie, joined our
        team.  The restaurant name was derived from the owners' names, Kevin &
        Charlene.  


        KC's offers a full breakfast menu, though we also offer catering for any occasion (up to ~100 people).  Outdoor seating is available starting in the Spring season! Planning an outdoor day trip? We'll be offering Grab N Go lunches to take on your adventure. Inquire within!


        KC's Kitchen & Catering is open to the public year round 7:00 a.m. - Noon every Friday - Sunday.

        The Yankee Trail Motel boasts 3 professional regulation horseshoe pits
        that can also be used for corn hole.  The owner, Charlene, is an avid
        horseshoe pitcher and seeks to plan weekly pick up games, as well as
        organized tournaments, for locals and travelers.  20% of any tournament
        fees are slated for quarterly local community donations, while the
        remainder goes to winner payouts.

      text: In February 2020, we welcomed Rick and Lise Miller from Salem, NH, to our
        team.  Rick and Lise graciously pulled themselves from the depths of
        retirement to work their magic in our kitchen to help get us started -
        and a great start it was!  While Rick and Lise will return to the joys
        of retirement, they plan to stay on board as part of our family to
        assist in any restaurant back-up activities or property enhancement
        projects. We are forever indebted, and they will forever be a part of
        the Yankee Trail family!

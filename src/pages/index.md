description: Yankee Trail is located near the famous Squam Lake, or 'On Golden
  Pond' as it was known in the famous 1981 movie with Henry Fonda and Katharine
  Hepburn, in Holderness, New Hampshire. Our family-owned and operated motel is
  also close to Lakes Winnipesaukee, Little Squam, Newfound Lake and more. We
  pride ourselves in making your trip to the Lakes and Mountains Region an
  affordable and unforgettable experience. Join us in the in-season for lake
  fun, concerts, or mountain hiking; or in the off-season for mountain snow,
  frozen lake fun, snowmobiling or comedy! There's so much offered here in the

        The former Breakfast Restaurant was completely remodeled in Spring
        2021.  In August 2022, our business model was modified to lower
        expenses, while providing improved alignment to the manageable
        retirement life we envisioned. 


        With breakfast now included in our room rates, our restaurant is dedicated to serving our motel guests only.  Our guests get to experience that Bed & Breakfast vibe with the luxury of enjoying their own private space, separate from the owners.  


        The restaurant now serves more as our kitchen, dining and living space where we invite our guests to join us for breakfast appetizers while we make your breakfast to order.  We have no menu.  We primarily cook your basic American breakfast options to order or provide homemade specials. 


        When arranged in advance with your reservation, our dining space is available to group guests as a common area for gathering in hot, cold, or inclement weather.  BBQ or other Dinner options are available upon request for guests arriving in groups.


        Guests are also welcome to utilize the outdoor BBQ grill for their own use, should you choose to have dinner at 'home'.


        Off Season (Nov-Apr):  8:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m.

        In-Season (May-Oct):  7:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m.

        windows, and, well, everything. This demonstrates a sample of one of our

        Forever Grateful


        This is Rick and Lise Miller from Salem, NH.  Our dear friends who graciously helped get us started - be it tearing down walls, sewing curtains, painting, prepping the restaurant, baking  homemade muffins, painting, serving the omelets and home fries with bacon/sausage, (did I mention painting?), splitting firewood, building campfires, serving crockpot dinners - there was no job too small.  And there was a little painting needed.


        While Rick left us for his eternal journey in 2022, we are forever grateful to them both for their friendship, support, and the elbow grease and restaurant expertise they gave us to get started. We are honored to consider them family.

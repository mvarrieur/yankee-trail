        Our Breakfast Restaurant is currently under renovation and will
        hopefully open soon, once the COVID-19 event is over.  We are busy
        planning our breakfast menu and anticipate providing our guests a
        delicious hot meal to enjoy before beginning each day's adventure! 
        Selections will include your basic pancakes, french toast, bacon and egg
        options, as well as pancake pops for those young at heart and incredible
        breakfast sandwiches on grilled french bread!  Mmm....

        In February 2020, we welcomed Rick and Lise Miller to our team.  Rick
        and Lise have graciously pulled themselves from the depths of retirement
        to work their magic in our kitchen.  Lise is a former restaurant owner
        and brings with her behind-the-scenes restaurant experience, as much as
        she brings experience from behind the griddle.  You will not be
        disappointed!
